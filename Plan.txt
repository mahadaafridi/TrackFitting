Potential Issues and Solutions
Feature Scaling:

Ensure that the scaling of features is appropriately handled. If the scale of tan_lambda values is very different from alpha and kappa, it might be worth scaling tan_lambda separately or giving it more attention in the loss function.
Model Complexity:

The current model architecture may not be complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Experimenting with deeper networks or different architectures could help. Consider adding more layers or increasing the number of neurons per layer.
Parameter Initialization:

The neural network's initial weights can impact training. Trying different weight initialization methods might improve performance.
Learning Rate:

The learning rate might be too high or too low, preventing the model from converging to a good solution. Experiment with different learning rates or use learning rate scheduling.
Loss Function:

The MSE loss might not be the best choice if the range of tan_lambda is very different from the other parameters. Customizing the loss function to give more weight to tan_lambda or using a different loss function altogether might help.
Data Quality and Quantity:

If the dataset contains noise or outliers, especially for the tan_lambda parameter, it might affect the model's ability to learn. Cleaning the data or using techniques like robust scaling can help. Additionally, more data can often help improve the model's performance.
Separate Models for Different Parameters:

Training separate models for each parameter (alpha, kappa, tan_lambda) might allow each model to specialize and perform better.
