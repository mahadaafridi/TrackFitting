# TrackFitting

This project involves the generation and fitting of helical trajectories to predict key parameters (alpha, kappa, tan_lambda) using a curve-fitting method and a feed forward neural network model. 

- **src/**: Contains the core Python scripts for data generation, helix fitting, and neural network modeling.
- **data/**: Directory for storing input datasets, including hit data for helix generation.
- **logs/**: Directory for log files generated during script execution.
- **results/**: Directory for output files, including statistics and plots.
